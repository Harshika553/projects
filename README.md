Yelp is a platform where customers can write reviews and provide star ratings for businesses. Research shows that a one-star increase in ratings can lead to a 59% revenue boost for independent restaurants, making the Yelp dataset a valuable source of insights. This project focuses on analyzing reviews from seven types of cuisines—Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, French, and Italian—to identify factors that contribute to positive or negative customer experiences. The goal is to understand what makes a restaurant successful, what concerns customers, and to offer recommendations for improvement and profit growth.

The dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, contains 5.2 million user reviews and details for 174,000 businesses. Two main tables are used: the business table, which includes attributes like business ID, name, location, ratings, review counts, and categories; and the review table, which contains review IDs, user IDs, business IDs, ratings, dates, review text, and counts of “useful,” “funny,” and “cool” votes.

The analysis process involves exploratory data analysis to count restaurants and reviews by cuisine type, visualize rating distributions, and clean the category data into standardized cuisine types. Business IDs are linked to reviews to perform sentiment analysis, identifying frequent positive and negative words. An SVM model is applied to score each word, and the top 10 positive and negative words for each cuisine type are extracted. Comparisons are then made across cuisines to determine strengths, weaknesses, and targeted recommendations for improvement in areas like service, food, and ambiance.

Data preparation included filtering U.S. restaurants, categorizing cuisines with keyword matching, removing incomplete data, and labeling reviews as positive, negative, or neutral (neutral reviews were dropped). A bag-of-words approach was used to calculate word frequencies, and sentiment scores were computed and normalized. The data was reshaped, reindexed, and visualized to show distributions of restaurants, reviews, and top sentiment words for each cuisine type. A polarity score was also calculated for each category.

Findings reveal that “delicious” is the most common positive word across most cuisines, suggesting that taste is the most important factor for customers, followed by friendly service and food freshness. Vietnamese and Italian restaurants are praised for freshness, French for sweet dishes, and Japanese for creativity. Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Thai cuisines receive high ratings for friendly service and variety, while Italian cuisine is valued for classic dishes and French restaurants for romantic ambiance.

Negative feedback shows that “bland” is a common issue for Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines, with customers expecting spicier flavors. Cold food is a frequent complaint for French, Italian, and Japanese restaurants, while “sour” appears in negative Chinese cuisine reviews. Slow service affects Korean and French restaurants, and high prices are a notable drawback for French establishments. Thai cuisine also receives negative feedback for greasy food.

These insights can help restaurant owners identify specific factors driving customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. By understanding common themes in reviews, owners can address weaknesses, enhance strengths, and compare performance against similar restaurants in their category.
